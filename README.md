## Organizer for .PDFs bills and invoices files

a VERY small program to organize invoices and bills

This little Python script allow you to organize your PDF bills in a folder with a standard name system and put many registers as items in a simple text file, easy to export to your favorite spreedsheet software over comma separated values files (.csv)

ToDo's :
- Add a folder for DATA with all imported invoices on a INVOICES and possible a sort system per Month and Year 
/BillOr/DATA/2024/01
/BillOr/DATA/2024/02.. 12
/BillOr/DATA/invoices.csv

- Put rechnungen.csv on DATA folder
- Test if they (files and folders) exist, if <not> then create, if exist then use it
- For "Ordner mounten" ask the script on consola for password, but should be on tkinter. And... what do it?
- Remove the section "ARTIKEL", billor should not to be a Accounting System, only a simple Invoices-organizer
- Sort the buttons under
- Add a Info
